    Today I learned how to say hello world!
        I said "Hello World!".
    That's all about how to say hello world.
    Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.

# üìù Notes

-   fim is just a personal hobby project, seeing as FiM++ has never been updated for quite some time now.

-   The syntax used here will follow a modified `Sparkle 1.0` syntax, unlike what [fimpp](https://github.com/KarolS/fimpp) uses. Please refer to the sample reports to see the differences.
