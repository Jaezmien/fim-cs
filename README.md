# üìù Notes

-   fim is just a personal hobby project, seeing as FiM++ has never been updated for quite some time now.

-   The syntax used here will follow a modified `Sparkle 1.0` syntax, unlike what [fimpp](https://github.com/KarolS/fimpp) uses. Please refer to the sample reports to see the differences.

# üñ• Usage
## CLI

```sh
$ ./fim Reports/hello.fim
Hello World!
```

## As a library 

```csharp
using fim;
using fim.celestia;

Interpreter i = Letter.WriteLetter(
    """
    Dear Princess Celestia: Hello World!
    Today I learned how to say hello world!
        I said "Hello World!".
    That's all about how to say hello world.
    Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
    """
);

interpreter.MainParagraph?.Execute(); // Outputs "Hello World!" into the console.
```

See the [reports folder](./fim.cli/Reports/), or the [tests project](./fim.tests/) for sample reports you can run on fim.
