Dear Princess Celestia: Conditionals!

Today I learned how to do conditionals!

    Did you know that Twilight is the argument correct?
    Did you know that Spike is the argument incorrect?

	(Equality Tests)
	I said "Twilight == Spike > " plus Twilight is equal to Spike.
	I said "Twilight == true > " plus Twilight is equal to the logic yes.
	I said "Twilight == false > " plus Twilight is equal to the logic no.
	I said "Spike == true > " plus Spike is equal to the logic true.
	I said "Spike == false > " plus Spike is equal to the logic false.

	(Inequality Tests)
	I said "Twilight != Spike > " plus Twilight isn't equal to Spike.
	I said "Twilight != true > " plus Twilight isn't equal to the logic yes.
	I said "Twilight != false > " plus Twilight isn't equal to the logic no.
	I said "Spike != true > " plus Spike isn't equal to the logic true.
	I said "Spike != false > " plus Spike isn't equal to the logic false.

	(Operators)
	I said "Twilight && Spike > " plus Twilight and Spike.
	I said "Twilight || Spike > " plus Twilight or Spike.
	I said "!Twilight > " plus not Twilight.
	I said "!Spike > " plus not Spike.

That's all about how to do conditionals.
