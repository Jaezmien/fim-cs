Dear Princess Celestia: Hello World!

Today I learned how to say hello world!

    I said "Hello World!".

	I quickly said "Hello".
	I quickly said " ".
	I quickly said "Equestria!".

That's all about how to say hello world.

Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.

P.S. This is a code in a paragraph-like structure!
