Dear Princess Celestia: Arrays!


Today I learned how to make arrays!

    (Without initialized values)
    Did you know that banana is the word "Banana Cake"?
    Did you know that carrot is the number 4? (Pointer - 4)

    Did you know that cake has many words?
    1 of cake is the word "Mango Cake". (Index 1)
    2 of cake is "Strawberry Cake". (Index 2)
    3 of cake is banana. (Index 3)
    cake of carrot is "Carrot Cake". (Index 4)

    carrot got one less.

    I said carrot of cake. (Index 3)

    (With initialized values)
    Did you know that Apples has the words "Gala", "Red Delicious", "Mcintosh", "Honeycrisp"?

    I said 1 of Apples.

That's all about how to make arrays.
