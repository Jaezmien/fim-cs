Dear Princess Celestia: While Loops!

Today I learned how to execute while loops.

	Did you know that Spike is the number 1?

	As long as Spike is no greater than 5...
		I said Spike.
		Spike got one less.
	That's what I did!

That's all about how to execute while loops.

Your faithful student, Jaezmien Naejara.
