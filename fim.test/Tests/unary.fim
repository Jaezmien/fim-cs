Dear Princess Celestia: Unaries!

Today I learned how to apply unaries.
	
	I said "-- Variable --".
	Did you know that Spike is the number 1?

	I said Spike.
	Spike got one more.
	I said Spike.
	Spike got one less.
	I said Spike.

	I said "-- Array --".
	Did you know that Owlowiscious is the numbers 1, 2, 3?

	I said 1 of Owlowiscious.
	I said 2 of Owlowiscious.
	I said 3 of Owlowiscious.

	1 of Owlowiscious got one more.
	2 of Owlowiscious got one more.
	3 of Owlowiscious got one more.

	I said 1 of Owlowiscious.
	I said 2 of Owlowiscious.
	I said 3 of Owlowiscious.

That's all about how to apply unaries.

Your faithful student, Jaezmien Naejara.
